mongomovies is no longer going to be updated, desu is making a version using localy hosted files, and maybe i will ask him to publish it

for now, i do not feel like updating the sources, i do not want to circimvent the protections that the 2 sources have put in place to prevent taking the movies

if anyone has some suggestions for sources to add that i can easly scrape the embeded video frame or get the video file directly (better) than suggest then in the github issues i may update the app, but for now project is shelved
